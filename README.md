<h1>Spotify Clone Project <h1>

https://spotify-clone-egt.netlify.app

The example Spotify clone project we've created is designed entirely faithful to the original. It's implemented using HTML, SASS, and JavaScript code. Data is fetched using the fetch method from the Shazam API endpoint and displayed on the screen. HTML forms the structure of the project. SASS is used for styling the project and creating its responsive layout. JavaScript code makes the project dynamic. Loading screen and day-night mode functionalities are designed by using code from iuiverse.oi. SASS is used to ensure the readability of the code, and JavaScript files are modularized.
